<h1>Cashier System</h1>
    <p>This is a cashier system that I am using to <b>improve my programming skills.</b>
    </p>
    <p>The system consists of some basic cashier functions and is <b>integrated 
    with a database</b>. 
    <i>in this specific case, I am using</i> <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is the goal of this project?</h2>
    <p>The objective of the project is to perform integrations with external tools (<b>such as the database 
    itself and even payment institutions</b>).</p>
    <p>This way, I will be able to enhance my level of code organization and 
    complexity.</p>

<h2>What has been done so far?</h2>
    <ol>
	    <li>Integration with PostgreSQL</li>
	    <li>Code organization (Importing own libraries, functions, etc.)</li>
        <li>Applied the best pratices into the repository and code itself</li>
        <li>Use of classes, functions and so on</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Goals to achieve:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><s>Register a purchase in the system with client data</s></li>
	    <li>Integration with a payment method</li>
	    <li><s>Customer registration</s></li>
	    <li>Sending emails/SMS to customers</li>
	    <li><s>Product stock withdrawal</s></li>
        <li>Produce a web-based interface of the cashier system
    </ul>
