<h1>Cashier System</h1>
<p>This is a cashier system that I am using to <strong>improve my programming skills</strong>.</p>
<p>The system consists of some basic cashier functions and is <strong>integrated with a database</strong>; in this specific case, I am using <em>PostgreSQL</em>.</p>
<h2>What is the goal of this project?</h2>
<p>The objective of the project is to perform integrations with external tools (<strong>such as the database itself and even payment institutions</strong>).</p>
<p>This way, I will be able to enhance my level of code organization and complexity.</p>
<h2>What has been done so far?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Integration with PostgreSQL</li>
	<li>Code organization (Importing own libraries, functions, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals to achieve:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Integration with a payment method</li>
	<li>Customer registration</li>
	<li>Sending emails/SMS to customers</li>
	<li><s>Product stock withdrawal</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestions regarding the project (appearance, technique, etc.) will be greatly appreciated!
